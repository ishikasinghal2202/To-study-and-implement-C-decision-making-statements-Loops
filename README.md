# To-study-and-implement-C-decision-making-statements-Loops

AIM:

            Decision-making statements allow your program to make choices based on conditions. They control the flow of execution depending on logical decisions, making your program dynamic and responsive.


SOFTWARE USED:

              VS Code


OBJECTIVE:

             1.Control program flow.
             2.Implement real-world logic.
             3.Write flexible and interactive programs.
             4.Avoid redundancy.

THEORY:

Desicion making statements-

              - Control the flow of execution based on conditions.
              - Make programs responsive to different inputs or situations.
              - Implement real-world logic using constructs like if, else, and switch.
              - Handle multi-way decisions in a clean, readable way.
              - Enable interactive programs that adapt during runtime.
              
Loops-

              - Repeat actions efficiently without writing redundant code.
              - Process collections or arrays of data automatically.
              - Control iterations with precise entry and exit conditions.
              - Save time and enhance scalability in large programs.
              - Support algorithmic patterns like searching, sorting, or simulation.

Types of descion making statements:-

              - The if statement checks whether a condition is true, and executes a block if it is.
              - The if-else structure offers a fallback when the condition is false.
              - The if-else-if ladder is useful when multiple conditions must be evaluated in sequence.
              - Nested if statements allow layered decisions inside other decisions.
              - The switch statement is cleaner and more efficient when youâ€™re checking a single variable against multiple constant values.
              - The ternary operator ?: is a shorthand used for simple conditions and assignments.

Types of loops:-

              - A for loop is best when the number of repetitions is known ahead of time. It includes initialization, condition check, and update in a single line.
              - A while loop checks the condition before each iteration, making it useful when the number of repetitions is unknown.
              - A do-while loop guarantees at least one execution before checking the condition.
              - Loops can be nested, meaning one loop runs inside another, helpful for matrices or multidimensional data.
