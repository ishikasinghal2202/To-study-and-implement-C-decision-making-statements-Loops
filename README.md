# To-study-and-implement-C-decision-making-statements-Loops

AIM:

            Decision-making statements allow your program to make choices based on conditions. They control the flow of execution depending on logical decisions, making your program dynamic and responsive.


SOFTWARE USED:

              VS Code


OBJECTIVE:

             1.Control program flow.
             2.Implement real-world logic.
             3.Write flexible and interactive programs.
             4.Avoid redundancy.

THEORY:

Desicion making statements-

              - Control the flow of execution based on conditions.
              - Make programs responsive to different inputs or situations.
              - Implement real-world logic using constructs like if, else, and switch.
              - Handle multi-way decisions in a clean, readable way.
              - Enable interactive programs that adapt during runtime.
              
Loops-

              - Repeat actions efficiently without writing redundant code.
              - Process collections or arrays of data automatically.
              - Control iterations with precise entry and exit conditions.
              - Save time and enhance scalability in large programs.
              - Support algorithmic patterns like searching, sorting, or simulation.

Types of descion making statements:-

              - The if statement checks whether a condition is true, and executes a block if it is.
              - The if-else structure offers a fallback when the condition is false.
              - The if-else-if ladder is useful when multiple conditions must be evaluated in sequence.
              - Nested if statements allow layered decisions inside other decisions.
              - The switch statement is cleaner and more efficient when you’re checking a single variable against multiple constant values.
              - The ternary operator ?: is a shorthand used for simple conditions and assignments.

Types of loops:-

              - A for loop is best when the number of repetitions is known ahead of time. It includes initialization, condition check, and update in a single line.
              - A while loop checks the condition before each iteration, making it useful when the number of repetitions is unknown.
              - A do-while loop guarantees at least one execution before checking the condition.
              - Loops can be nested, meaning one loop runs inside another, helpful for matrices or multidimensional data.


SAMPLE OUTPUT:

      Print even values between 0 and 10:

                                       0 2 4 6 8 10

     Use a for loop to print “SIT" 5 times:

                                      SIT
                                      SIT
                                      SIT
                                      SIT
                                      SIT


CONCLUSION:

Programs built with decision-making statements and loops demonstrate the power of structured logic and flow control in programming. These constructs allow developers to make dynamic decisions (if, else, switch) and efficiently execute repetitive tasks (for, while, do-while).

By incorporating conditions into loops, such programs can:

        - Adapt to user inputs or changing data.
        - Optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary executions.
        - Reduce redundancy through iteration.
        - Handle multiple scenarios through conditional branching.

Together, decision-making and loops form the foundation of real-world applications—from calculators and grading systems to data processors and game engines. Mastering these concepts strengthens both algorithmic thinking and your ability to design responsive, intelligent software.
